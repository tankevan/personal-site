            Was the school prefectorial board I was part of. The board of 70
            deliberates about, plans and executes the school rules, events and
            student welfare activities. Being a prefect put me in a unique position
            which allowed me to hone my skills in leadership. It was an environment
            where strong minded individuals worked together and feedback was quick
            to be given. The experience is definitely a big part of what I am today.

            I served as the House Captain in my fourth year. The job involved working
            with a team of 12 to manage and organize events for a house of 400 people.
            Houses were typically not a priority for students because unlike CCAs, houses
            bring people of varying abilities together with little to unite them under
            other than a concept of a House. However, I can say that in our year, we
            showed the school what a bonded House can do. Despite the events being
            sparsely spread out through the year, our House showed up in force every
            time and gave our hearts for each event. Because our members were willing
            to change their mindsets and put in the hard work, I dare say that we brightened
            up the House scene in our own way.

            Infocomm Club was my first foray into the world of technology. As a
            year one student, I had seniors that exposed me to different areas
            such as Robotics, Networking, and programming languages (PHP in this case)
            and that got me exploring a few areas on my own. As a result of looking
            for my niche, I’ve had experience with 3D software (Blender, C4D),
            programming languages (C++, Python) and got a chance to apply these skills
            in competitions.

            Our club consists of a programming and design section. In this club,
             we conduct the lessons ourselves. I really enjoyed looking for and
             sharing whatever knowledge we have about programs (Photoshop,
             Illustrator etc.) and programming related areas (Ruby on Rails,
             algorithms) with our fellow members.

            Raffles Invent is an enrichment program that was held every Monday
            morning in JC1. The program brought us through the process of
            designing and building our very own application. This program was
            what exposed me to web development technologies (we used Ruby on
            Rails then). And thanks to the grant, we were fortunate enough to
            attend the Rails Conference held in Singapore even though we were
            newbies.

        <h1>Five Loaves</h1>
        <p>
          Five Loaves is a church bakery that serves the community of St Mary of
          the Angels in Bukit Batok. I started volunteering there in 2009. Just
          like any other bakeries, we bake and sell breads, cakes and puffs. In
          the year, there are a few events that call for more work – Easter,
          Mother’s Day, Christmas (to name a few). What keeps me committed is
          that the bakery is big on community, we always take the time to get to
          know each other and develop a bond. As a result, it’s always more fun
          than a chore to get things done in the bakery. I joined back in secondary
          school because I had an interest towards baking (and now cooking). I
          was amazed by how everyday ingredients like egg white, egg yolk and
          milk can be transformed into a whole range of textures and taste with
          the addition of another ingredient or with the skilful use of heat.
          Before I knew about electronics or programming, this was what I made,
          with my hands.

        <h1>Wing Chun</h1>
        <p>
          I took up this martial art in 2012, when I tried to take up something
          physical to be more active, perhaps a little bit influenced by the Ip
          Man movies as well. What struck me about Wing Chun was how much force
          its practitioners could generate while seemingly relaxed. I would come
          to learn that this paradox, is just one of many in the martial art.
          The principles of Wing Chun were a shock to me (because of how
          contradictory they were) but as I practiced, it changed my way of
          thinking about force, fighting and consequentially, life. The members
          of the group I was training with were analytical in their methods, we
          try to rationalize every move and of course, there were tests,
          experiments we would do on each other to make sure our structure was
          correct. Unlike the traditional method of repetition, this iterative
          process of understanding something mysterious is fun and keeps me coming
          back for me.
